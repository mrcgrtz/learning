# [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)

> You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of Fortran. - Alan Perlis

This is me learning some Fortran. Move along, dude. :wave:

## Required stuff

You need [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling Fortran programs.

On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) run:

```bash
brew install gcc
```

## Usage

To compile the source files using the GNU Fortran compiler run:

```bash
gfortran -o bin/<file> src/<file>.f
```
